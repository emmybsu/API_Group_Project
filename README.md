# API_Group_Project

  Our project will explore City Grid Media and Census data to uncover relationships between major city food types, rankings, and other demographic insights.  
 
 Some example questions are:
    1. Which of the major five cities for barbeque have the best overall rankings?
    2. Do we see any correlation between rankings and any demographics?
    3. How does sushi rank across the 5 largest US Cities?

These questions may change as we do the data exploration and attribute availability.
