# API_Group_Project

  Our project will explore City Grid Media and Census data to uncover relationships between major city food types, rankings, and other demographic insights.  
 
 Some example questions are:
    1. Which of the major five cities for barbeque have the best overall rankings?
    2. Do we see any correlation between rankings and any demographics?
    3. How does sushi rank across the 5 largest US Cities?

  Actual Questions:
  1. Out of the cities deemed top places for bbq (defined by us):
    Austin, TX
    Memphis, TN
    Kansas City, MO
    Charlotte, NC
    NYC, NY
  What is the average review rating?
  What is the volume of reviews for proper weighting?
    - summary stats for the reviews
  2. What cities have the largest amount of reviews for BBQ restaurants?
  3. What city has the lowest rating and highest rating overall?

We are focusing on the CityGrid data and will use census if and as needed.
